# Uber-Data-Analysis
End-to-End DataScience Casestudy
# About the Project
The main aim of the  project is to analyze data to summarize their main characteristics with visual methods and to predict the price using  Machine Learning Model. 

# Overview
In this project we  have made  exploratory data analytics on uber dataset and came to know the effect of each field on price with every other field of the dataset. Then we apply different machine learning models to complete the analysis,Then the best performing model was suggested for further predictions of the label ‘Price’.

The analysis is broken up into 3 sections:
- Data Loading and Preparation.
- Exploration and visualization 
- Prediction.

# Technologies Used
  - Python
  - numpy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib

# Conclution
This project analyzes multiple attributes related to Uber cabs that allows to get better insights regarding the functioning of the multi national cab company
and We have used  machine learning algorithms to predict the price of Uber, so that it is easy for the company to do analysis on price based on certain features.
